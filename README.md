## Best Practices

### GitHub Best Practices

- **Branching**: Use feature branches for new features and bug fixes. Example: `git checkout -b feature/new-feature`
- **Pull Requests**: Create pull requests for code reviews and maintain a clean main branch.
- **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation to help others understand and contribute to your project.

### Design Best Practices

- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your site is mobile-friendly and looks good on all devices.
- **User Experience (UX)**: Focus on intuitive navigation and a clean layout.
- **Accessibility**: Make sure your website is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Performance Optimization**: Optimize images and minimize CSS/JS files for faster load times.

## SEO Optimization Techniques

- **Meta Tags**: Use descriptive and keyword-rich meta titles and descriptions.
- **Alt Text**: Add descriptive alt text to all images.
- **Header Tags**: Use header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to structure content and improve readability.
- **URL Structure**: Use clean and descriptive URLs. Example: `/about/` instead of `/page?id=123`
- **Sitemap**: Include a sitemap to help search engines index your pages.
- **Robots.txt**: Use a `robots.txt` file to control how search engines crawl your site.
